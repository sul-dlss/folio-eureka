# mod-inventory-storage requires REPLICATION_FACTOR to be set as env variable because it creates necessary topics on its own
# and it won’t be overridden by the kafka configured setting.
# In addition to setting the number of pod replicas, REPLICATION_FACTOR env is set using the replicaCount setting
replicaCount: 3

# Include the extraEnvVars from the chart, and then add our REPLICATION_FACTOR.
